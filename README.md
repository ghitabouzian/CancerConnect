# CancerConnect
 CancerConnect is our solution to the lack of digital communities for cancer patients and the lack of child-friendly educational resources. 
 
 CancerConnect offers a social network for kids who suffer from cancer to connect with one another. There are also educational resources and children-friendly simplified Cancer explanations to educate people on the topic.
Key points:
- Anonymity 
- Connection 
- Simplified Resources
- Chatbot (navigate & report issues)

*Key statistics:
- Childhood cancer survivors are 2x as likely to suffer chronic health conditions.
- 47 children are diagnosed with cancer in the US everyday = +17,000 each year.
This problem is important because people most only care about the physical negative impact of Cancer but never the emotional states of the patients and how the disease will affect their thoughts and emotions.
