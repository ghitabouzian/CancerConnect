          <h1>What is Cancer?</h1>
        </center>
        <p class="card">Cells are the building blocks of life. Our bodies are made up of cells. All the time our body is
          regenerating new cells to make up for the old ones. Cancer is a disease that happens when bad cells stop the
          good cells from doing their job. These bad cells can grow into a lump and can spread to other parts of the
          body. Cancer is the name for over 200 diseases in which abnormal cells grow and rapidly divide. These cells
          usually develop into a lump called a tumour.</p>

          <h1>Leukemia</h1>
        </center>
        <p class="card">Leukemia refers to cancers of the white blood cells-your bone marrow makes large numbers of bad
          cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone
          marrow and blood. They repel healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do work. With
          treatment, most childhood leukemias have very high remission rates. Remission means that doctors see no cancer
          cells in the body.</p>

          <h1>Lymphoma</h1>
        </center>
        <p class="card"> Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is part of the body's germ-fighting
          network. The lymphatic system includes the lymph nodes (lymph glands), spleen, thymus gland and bone marrow.
          Lymphoma can affect all those areas as well as other organs throughout the body. Childhood lymphoma is rare.

          <h1>Childhood Cancer</h1>
        </center>
        <p class="card">In the United States in 2021, an estimated 10,500 new cases of cancer were diagnosed among
          children. Children's cancers are not always treated like adult cancers. Pediatric oncology is a medical
          specialty focused on the care of children with cancer. It's important to know that this expertise exists and
          that there are effective treatments for many childhood cancers.</p>

          <h1>CNS</h1>
        </center>
        <p class="card">A CNS tumor begins when healthy cells within the brain or the spinal cord change and grow out of
          control, forming a mass. A CNS tumor can be either cancerous or benign, and both types can potentially be
          dangerous. A cancerous tumor is malignant, meaning it can grow fast and spread to other parts of the body.</p>

          <h1>Neuroblastoma</h1>
        </center>
        <p class="card">Neuroblastoma is the most common malignant (cancerous) extracranial solid tumor of childhood.
          Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that starts in early nerve cells called neuroblasts. Normally, these
          immature cells grow into working nerve cells. But in neuroblastoma (nur-oh-bla-STOW-muh), they grow
          uncontrollably and become cancer cells that form a solid tumor. </p>

          <h1>Stigmas</h1>
        </center>
        <p class="card">Childhood cancers are not lifestyle-related and a child doesn't get cancer because of naughty
          behaviour. There’s nothing anyone did to cause the cancer. It’s not contagious you are safe around the child
          with cancer. If a sick child is in isolation, this is to protect the child from infection, not to protect
          everyone else from the cancer. Most children get better although cancer is a serious, life-threatening
          disease, the overall survival rate for children is now more than 80%</p>

          <h1>Kidney Tumors</h1>
        </center>
        <p class="card">Doctors know that kidney cancer begins when some kidney cells develop changes (mutations) in
          their DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The changes tell the cells to
          grow and divide rapidly. The accumulating abnormal cells form a tumor that can extend beyond the kidney.</p>

        <center>
          <h1>Bone Tumors</h1>
        </center>
        <p class="card">Some bone tumors are malignant (cancerous). Malignant bone tumors can metastasize — or cause
          cancer cells to spread throughout the body. In almost all cases, treatment for malignant tumors involves a
          combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.</p>
